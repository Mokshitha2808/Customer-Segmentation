# Customer Segmentation
                                      
## Project Overview:
This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics using the K-means clustering algorithm. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of different customer groups.

## Dataset : 
The dataset used for this project is the Mall_Customers dataset, which includes the following features:  
CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to the customer.  
Gender: Gender of the customer.  
Age: Age of the customer.  
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousand dollars.  
Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.  

## Project Structure:
Mall_Customers.csv: The dataset file.  
customer_segmentation.ipynb: The main notebook with data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.  
README.md: Project overview and instructions.  

## Installation:
1.	Clone the repository: 
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git  
    cd customer-segmentation  


## Usage:
1.	Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the Jupyter notebook.  
2.	Open customer_segmentation.ipynb and run the cells to see the analysis and clustering results.  

## Results:
The K-means clustering algorithm segments customers into distinct groups based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The results are visualized in scatter plots, showing the clusters and their centroids.

## Future Work:
•	Feature Engineering: Explore additional features that could improve clustering results.  
•	Model Comparison: Compare K-means clustering with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering.  
•	Customer Profiling: Develop detailed profiles for each customer segment to inform marketing strategies.  

## Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements:
